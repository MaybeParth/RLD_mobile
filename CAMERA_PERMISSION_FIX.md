# Camera Permission Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The app was asking for camera permission even though it's not needed for CSV export functionality.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Removed unnecessary camera permission requests and kept only the storage permission that's actually required.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Removed Camera Permission Methods**
- Removed `requestCameraPermission()` method
- Removed `hasCameraPermission()` method
- Removed camera permission checks from `requestAllPermissions()`

### **2. Updated Permission Status Dialog**
- **Before**: Showed both Storage and Camera permissions
- **After**: Shows only Storage permission (the one actually needed)
- **Added**: Clear explanation of what storage permission allows

### **3. Simplified Permission Flow**
- **Only requests storage permission** when exporting data
- **No camera permission requests** anywhere in the app
- **Cleaner permission status** showing only relevant permissions

## 🎯 **Current Permission Behavior**

### **What the App Requests**
- **Storage Permission Only**: For saving and sharing CSV files
- **When**: Only when you try to export data
- **Why**: To save patient data files locally and share them

### **What the App Does NOT Request**
- **Camera Permission**: Not needed for current functionality
- **Location Permission**: Not needed for current functionality
- **Microphone Permission**: Not needed for current functionality

## 📱 **User Experience Now**

### **Permission Dialog**
**Title**: "Storage Permission Required"
**Message**: "Storage permission is needed to save and share CSV files with your patient data."

**What this allows**:
- • Save CSV files with patient data
- • Share files via email or cloud storage
- • Export data for research and analysis
- • Backup patient information locally

### **Permission Status**
- **Shows only Storage permission** (the one actually needed)
- **Clear status**: ✅ Granted or ❌ Denied
- **Direct action**: Grant Storage button if denied
- **No confusion**: Only shows relevant permissions

## 🚀 **Result**

The app now only requests the permissions it actually needs:
- **Storage permission**: For CSV export functionality
- **No camera permission**: Removed unnecessary requests
- **Cleaner experience**: Users only see relevant permission requests
- **Better compliance**: Follows principle of least privilege

## 🎉 **Benefits**

### **For Users**
- **No confusion**: Only sees permissions that are actually needed
- **Faster setup**: Fewer permission requests
- **Better trust**: App only asks for what it uses
- **Clearer purpose**: Each permission has a clear reason

### **For App Store**
- **Better compliance**: Follows permission best practices
- **Higher approval chances**: No unnecessary permission requests
- **User-friendly**: Transparent about permission usage
- **Privacy-focused**: Minimal permission footprint

The app now has a clean, focused permission model that only requests what's actually needed for the CSV export functionality!
