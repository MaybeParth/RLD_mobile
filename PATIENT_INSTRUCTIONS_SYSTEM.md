## 📋 Instruction Content

### Calibration Instructions

#### Step 1: Position the Device
```
"Place the device on your leg as instructed by the clinician. 
Make sure it's secure and won't move during the test."

💡 Tip: The device should be firmly attached and not wobble 
when you move your leg slightly.
```

#### Step 2: Hold Still
```
"Keep your leg in the starting position and hold completely still. 
The device needs to measure your baseline position."

⏱️ This will take about 10-15 seconds. Try to relax and breathe normally.
```

#### Step 3: Gentle Flex
```
"When prompted, gently flex your leg 5-10 degrees (about 2-3 inches) 
without twisting. Hold for 2-3 seconds, then return to starting position."

📏 Small movement - just 2-3 inches. Don't bend too much.
```

### Test Execution Instructions

#### Ready Phase
```
"Wait for the 'RECORDING' signal before moving.
Let your leg drop naturally as fast as possible.
Catch and return your leg to starting position quickly."

💡 Remember: Don't try to control the drop speed - let it fall naturally!
```

#### Recording Phase
```
"The test is now recording. You can perform the leg drop test at any time.

What to do now:
1. Let your leg drop naturally
2. Catch it and return to starting position
3. The system will detect your reaction automatically"
```
